# Event Management Platform
Develop a comprehensive event management system that allows event organizers to create, manage, and promote events while enabling attendees to discover, register for, and participate in events. The system should handle complex event logistics and provide real-time updates.

## Objective
Create a scalable web application that streamlines the entire event lifecycle from creation to post-event analytics, supporting multiple event types and user roles.

## Features: 
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Multi-Role User System: Support for event organizers, attendees, vendors, and platform administrators with role-specific dashboards and permissions
Event Creation and Management: Organizers can create events with detailed information, set ticket types and pricing, manage venue details, create event schedules, and handle speaker/performer management
Registration and Ticketing System: Attendees can browse events, purchase tickets with integrated payment processing, receive QR code tickets, and manage their event registrations
Real-Time Event Updates: Live notifications for schedule changes, venue updates, and important announcements with support for push notifications and email alerts
Check-In and Attendance Tracking: QR code scanning system for event entry, real-time attendance monitoring, and capacity management with waitlist functionality
Analytics and Reporting Dashboard: Comprehensive analytics for organizers including ticket sales, attendance patterns, revenue tracking, and post-event feedback analysis with exportable reports
